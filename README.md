# SPLASH-3-RISCV-port
RISC-V port of SPLASH-3 benchmarks.

Splash-3 is a benchmark suite based on Splash-2 but without data races. It was
first presented at [ISPASS'16](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7482078/).
The version used here for proting is originally taken from (https://github.com/SakalisC/Splash-3)

#1--> Compile
	   in Makefile.config
	   set CC := to your riscv-gcc compiler
	   set BASEDIR :=  to the dorectory where this makefile is located. 

#2--> Run

	Detail run instructions are given in the Readme file in the directory of each benchmark. Different sets of intputs are available to be used. For testing i only used the recommended inputs for running Splash-3 in a  Qemu-riscv64 simulator. I have used 4 processor core in each run and the exetuion time is provided in each README file just for example. The inputs used are based on the original Splash-2 characterization paper by Woo et al. [1].

      For the quick run use the following commands. 
      \# represents the number of processor cores/threads and RISCV-SIM represent your REISCV Simulator. 
	In my case #=4 and RISCV-SIM = qemu-riscv64

	APPS:
		RISCV-SIM ./BARNES < inputs/n16384-p#
		RISCV-SIM ./FMM < inputs/input.#.16384
		RISCV-SIM ./OCEAN -p# -n258
		RISCV-SIM ./RADIOSITY -p # -ae 5000 -bf 0.1 -en 0.05 -room -batch
		RISCV-SIM ./RAYTRACE -p# -m64 inputs/car.env
		RISCV-SIM ./VOLREND # inputs/head 8
		RISCV-SIM ./WATER-NSQUARED < inputs/n512-p#
		RISCV-SIM ./WATER-SPATIAL < inputs/n512-p#
	KERNELS:
		RISCV-SIM ./CHOLESKY -p# < inputs/tk15.O
		RISCV-SIM ./FFT -p# -m16
		RISCV-SIM ./LU -p# -n512
		RISCV-SIM ./RADIX -p# -n1048576
